Other plugin types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additionally to the list plugin types there are several others meant to give you the maximum flexibility. If you are using the
templates included in the extension you won't need them as they represent parts you'd normally want to have at fixed positions
in your templates. For special circumstances we provide these plugins as standalone versions so you can use them in every
way you want:

Sidebar
"""""""

The sidebar contains links enabling the user to quickly navigate your blog. It shows an overview of recent posts and comments,
categories, tags and archive links.

Metadata
""""""""
Displays post meta data, like date, tags, category, sharing links...


Comments / Comment Form
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Displays the comment form and comments to a post - be aware that commenting in general has to be globally enabled and the
respective post should have the commenting flag set.


Creating Categories and Tags
----------------------------

Categories are the default TYPO3 categories you probably already know.

Create a new category:

* Go to the list module
* Click on the page where you want to create the new category
* Click on the "new record" button on the top and choose category
* Enter a title for the category and choose a possible parent
* Click "Save"

Tags are blog specific records. Creating a new tag works in the same way as creating categories does:

* Go to list module
* Click on the page where you want to create the new tag
* Enter a title for the tag
* Click "Save"

Enable sharing
--------------

To enable sharing go to the page properties of your blog entry and set the check box "Sharing enabled"
